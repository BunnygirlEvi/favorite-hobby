            <p id="bio"> About: My favorite hobby is sculpting clay, or making clay figures. It's really fun to sculpt clay and stretch it into different shapes. And if i want to make a charm or have something that i made that i really like, i just bake it for 10 minutes then its hard to break. Sculpting clay is a hobby i got during quarentine. I was going to this department store to get school supplies then when we were in there, after a bit i found a clay set. I asked my mom to buy it and she said yes. When I got home i sculpted a lot of things. A sculpture of my pet bunny is my first poylmer clay sculpter. My first clay sculpter is actually a snail for an art project.</p>
